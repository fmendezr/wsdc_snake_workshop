main.py :
    - add conditional statement to game over method for collission with wall if so change game state attribute
    - call game over method at the end of the game loop 

# STEP 11 -> Collisions with self 

snake.py:
    -  Complete detect collission with self method in Snake class

main.py; 
    - add detect collission with self to the conditionoal statement in game over method 

---------MILESTONE 6---------

### STEP 12 -> GAME OVER screen ###

scoreboard.py:
    - Complete write_game_over method 

main.py;
    - if conditional statement in game over is true call the scoreboard's write game over method
